# Machine Learning Project Documentation

## Overview
This project implements a deep learning model for image classification using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The model is trained on a dataset of 10,000 labeled images across 10 different categories.

## Architecture
- **Input Layer**: 224x224x3 RGB images
- **Convolutional Layers**: 4 layers with ReLU activation
- **Pooling Layers**: Max pooling after each conv layer
- **Dense Layers**: 2 fully connected layers (512, 10 units)
- **Output**: Softmax activation for multi-class classification

## Training Details
- **Optimizer**: Adam with learning rate 0.001
- **Loss Function**: Categorical crossentropy
- **Batch Size**: 32
- **Epochs**: 100
- **Validation Split**: 20%

## Results
- **Training Accuracy**: 94.5%
- **Validation Accuracy**: 91.2%
- **Test Accuracy**: 90.8%

## Key Findings
1. Data augmentation improved generalization by 3-4%
